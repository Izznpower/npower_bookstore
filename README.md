1st DOM project.
Goal: To create a functioning bookstore webpage which user can add and delete books from a api DB.

Note: 

Accomplished:
1. Build from scatch.
2. Learned to use try..catch.
3. Practiced how fetch and api works.
4. Added tailwind css to html.
5. Practice table making in html.
6. Solified knowledge of loops. 

Porblem still need to be solved:
  1. horizontal scroll bar only show up in the bottom of the table. This could be annoying to see all column of the beginning of the table.
  2. Remove clumn that user don't need to know.
